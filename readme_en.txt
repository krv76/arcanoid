Project for Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0

You should change file game.cpp, you can add your modules, files etc.

Goal: make simple arcanoid in less than 4 hours: controllable platform,
ball, which flies and bounces from walls and platform and destroys bricks.
Game should react to ball falling off bottom side, for example it can
restart itself or exit.

Additional features (if you still have enough time), like falling bonuses
is a plus.

It's recomended to make code in such way that you can add more balls in future.

Rendering should be done per pixel in buffer (32-bit color BGRA) - look at game.cpp
It's enough (but not mandatory) to render everything (including ball) as rectangle.
